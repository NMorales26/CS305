Artemis Financial Vulnerability Assessment Report

Summary of Client and Software Requirements
Client: Artemis Financial
Artemis Financial is a company that manages customer funds, making the protection of sensitive information a top priority. The primary software requirements included ensuring secure communication channels to prevent unauthorized access and comply with government regulations. The main issue addressed was the lack of secure communication and potential vulnerabilities in their system.

Successes in Identifying Software Security Vulnerabilities
I successfully identified several critical vulnerabilities in the system, such as the lack of HTTPS for secure communication, the absence of an authentication system, and the acceptance of invalid inputs. Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial because secure coding practices ensure the stability and safety of the system, protecting both the company and its clients.

Importance of Coding Securely
Coding securely is vital because it prevents unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security incidents that could harm the companyâ€™s reputation and financial stability. Software security enhances the overall well-being of a company by safeguarding sensitive information, ensuring regulatory compliance, and maintaining customer trust.

Challenges and Learnings from the Vulnerability Assessment
The manual review and static testing phases were particularly challenging. Identifying vulnerabilities in dependencies and understanding the potential exploits required thorough research and detailed analysis. These challenges were helpful as they provided a deeper understanding of the importance of each security measure.

Increasing Layers of Security
To increase security layers, I implemented several measures, including transitioning all communications to HTTPS, sanitizing user inputs, enabling two-factor authentication, and updating vulnerable dependencies. In the future, I would use a combination of automated tools and manual reviews to assess vulnerabilities and decide on appropriate mitigation techniques.

Ensuring Functionality and Security
After refactoring the code, I conducted rigorous testing, including automated tests and manual reviews, to ensure the functionality and security of the software application. This process helped verify that no new vulnerabilities were introduced and that the application remained secure.

Useful Resources, Tools, and Coding Practices
Throughout this project, I utilized tools like dependency checkers and static code analysis tools. Secure coding practices such as input validation, using secure communication protocols, and regular updates to dependencies were essential in maintaining the security and functionality of the software. These tools and practices will be beneficial in future assignments and professional tasks.

Showcasing Skills to Employers
This assignment demonstrates my ability to conduct thorough security assessments, identify and mitigate vulnerabilities, and implement secure coding practices. These skills are crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of software systems, making this project a valuable example to show future employers.
